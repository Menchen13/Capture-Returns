It Works!
ITs finally over!
The skript successfully cracked the login page, after like 6 Weeks of gruelling work.

If you wanna use this for your self, build the container with the included Dockerfile and then enter the container and run the program with the parameters -u -l -p(descriptions of these will be output if you ommit any of them).
