It Works!
ITs finally over!
The skript successfully cracked the login page, after like 6 Weeks of gruelling work.
It was a very good learning project but i would not do it again!
If you wanna use this for your self, build the container with the included Dockerfile and then enter the container and run the program with the parameters -u -l -p(descriptions of these will be output if you ommit any of them).

If you have trouble building the container or something else seems is not working, do keep in mind this was my first time doing somethin like this so there are bound to be some bugs. If you want help troubleshooting message me on github and i will see if i can help.
