It Works!
ITs finally over!
The skript successfully cracked the login page, after like 6 Weeks of gruelling work.
It was a very good learning project but i would not do it again!
If you wanna use this for your self make sure you are on a maschine which is connectet to the TryHackMe VPN, then build the image from the Dockerfile and start the container using the -it flags to drop into a shell.
The Programm should be instsalled as "Capture-Returns", run the command: "Capture-Returns -l usernames.txt -p passwords.txt -u <\link to your instance>" and it should bruteforce the login page.

If you have trouble building the container or something else seems is not working, do keep in mind this was my first time doing somethin like this so there are bound to be some bugs. If you want help troubleshooting message me on github and i will see if i can help.
